3. Commands used: 
mkdir answers
cd answers 
nano answers.txt

4. /Users/gretchenwang/Github/assignment-1/answers/answers.txt

5. -a

6. if I use ls (path to other directory)

7. rm is a dangerous command because, if used without -i, it deletes your 
selected file forever without asking for confirmation. For example, if I'm 
deleting one file but I accidentally type the name of another 
similarly-named file that I want to keep, if I don't use -i then rm just 
deletes the file I wanted to keep with no chance for me to confirm or 
verify that I'm deleting the right file. 

8. mkdir results
