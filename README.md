I am a freshman at Brandeis this semester hoping to major in English and 
environmental studies, and minor in music and creative writing. My dream 
job is to be a literary agent or book publicist, but I consider a job in 
the environmental field more realistic and I would like to do 
research-related things in that field (but hopefully not for a 
morally-compromised corporation). I took this course because coding 
is a useful skill and I know that being able to code is important when 
doing data analysis for research. My hobbies are reading, writing, playing 
video games, and playing music.
